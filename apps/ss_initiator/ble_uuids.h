 *  The DWM1001 UUID was generated by the uuidgen utility, which gave
 *      de259bcd-1d7c-48db-a7e3-4759ac04d6b3
 *  The last two hex digits (0xd8, 0x98) were set to 0x00,0x00.
 *      de259bcd-1d7c-48db-a7e3-4759ac040000
 *  This string was reversed to form a byte array to conform to 
 *  Zephyr's BLE API specifications.

 *
 *  DWM1001 UUID Base (common part) are the last 14 bytes of UUID.
 *  The first two bytes will be Service or Characteristic unique values.
 *  This is similar to the UUID16-type UUIDs specified by the BT SIG.
